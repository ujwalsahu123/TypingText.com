Personalised - ai based - end to end - easy - Typing learning platform 
<hr>
looking to make a website for typing learning , and i want to make this project and do startup on this idea . (idea - making a typing learning platform where there will be 100 exercises that u have to in 100 days (1 exercise each day for about 30min- 1hr) and on day 101 your typing speed will be 50-100wpm . for making this work i have made a master formula consisting of drills , tests ,etc and i am working on to find the best ideal path so that anyone can learn typing easily without facing the hardness in the start where you feel like you cant do it .
The startup part is - there are very less who know touch typing in my class , in my college 80% of the people in cs , it , computer branch dosent know touch typing and have less than 30wpm which makes it hard for them to be efficient and speed when working on computers . and i think touch typing is a very basic and easy skill that anyone can have . but people dont know where to learn from and how to learn it . there is no path provided for them to learn -thats what i wanna solve - weather you are working in the industry or in college or school you can learn touch typing and here is a ideal path , u just have to put 30min a day and do exercises daily and you will also have this amazing skill. i want to market this idea in colleges and if this thing becomes big then i will think to make a friendly software (typing , programming learning , web dev learning) for school students with collabortion with the school and the teaching department , since these are also important skills that a kid need to learn , this skills are being taught in america , and other country but not in india .
please share your thoughts on this with me .
Thankyou .

idea is not enough , i have to make a mvp and it should show that the idea really works and its great . and i think making the initial stage(Minimum mvp) of the platform by myself will be good and also chencking if it works , and then making a good team or getting investment. and along side i should also put time in the idea and the vision and the solution . and in the free time do entrepreneurship like ( pitch deck , business plan , growth , etc things that is required for investment and startup purpose )
